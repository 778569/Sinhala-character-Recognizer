# Sinhala-character-Recognizer
An interactive Sinhala character recognizer implemented using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with a user-friendly Tkinter-based graphical user interface. Browse and classify Sinhala characters effortlessly. Check out the code on GitHub!

## Data and Target
in here we have images and if we draw a sinhala letter, model should predict it.<br>

## Split data 

in here I am split 20% data as a test and 80 for train.
