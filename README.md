# Sinhala-character-Recognizer
An interactive Sinhala character recognizer implemented using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with a user-friendly Tkinter-based graphical user interface. Browse and classify Sinhala characters effortlessly. Check out the code on GitHub!

## Data and Target
in here we have images and if we draw a sinhala letter, model should predict it.<br>

## Image Filtering

In here we are devide that images into pixels.<br>

## Split data 

in here I am split 20% data as a test and 80 for train.

## K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (Classifier)

* K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) is very simple, easy to understand, versatile and one of topmost machine recognition algorithms.
* KNN used in the variety of applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition and video recognition.
* In credit ratings, financial institutes will predict the credit rating of customers.
* In loan desbursement, banking institutes will predict whether the lone is safe or risky, in political science, classifying potential voters in two classes will vote or wont vote
* KNN algorithm used for both classification and regression problems.KNN algorithm based on feature similarity approach.
